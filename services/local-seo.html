    <h2>What is Local SEO and why it matters</h2>
    <p>Local SEO aligns three signals so nearby customers can find you without ads: your Google Business Profile, your website content, and your citations. When these match, Google trusts who you are, what you offer, and where you operate. That trust shows up as more map impressions, direction requests, and phone calls.</p>

    <h3>Our process</h3>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Quick audit</strong> — find indexing issues, category mismatches, duplicate listings, and missing content.</li>
      <li><strong>Profile tuning</strong> — correct categories, services, hours, photos, products/menus, and Q&amp;A.</li>
      <li><strong>On-page alignment</strong> — service pages that match search intent with clear offers and schema.</li>
      <li><strong>Citations &amp; NAP</strong> — consistent name, address, and phone across top directories.</li>
      <li><strong>Reviews &amp; photos</strong> — a simple system to earn steady, authentic reviews and fresh visuals.</li>
      <li><strong>Tracking &amp; reporting</strong> — GA4 events and UTM tags so you see which channels produce leads.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>What you get</h3>
    <ul class="checklist">
      <li>Google Business Profile set up correctly with ongoing updates</li>
      <li>Local landing pages for Apple Valley, Eagan, Burnsville, and Rosemount when needed</li>
      <li>Faster pages, better internal links, and clean titles and meta</li>
      <li>Monthly report with calls, direction requests, and form fills</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Timeline and expectations</h3>
    <p>Most clients see movement within 2 to 4 weeks after core fixes ship. Competitive terms and larger markets take longer. We focus on steady, compounding improvements you can measure.</p>

      <h3>FAQs</h3>
      <details><summary>Do I need city pages for every nearby town</summary><p>Not always. We start with strong service pages and one Locations page. We add city pages only when competition requires it.</p></details>
      <details><summary>What if I do not have many reviews</summary><p>We implement a simple ask flow that fits your brand. Even a few new reviews a month move the needle.</p></details>
      <details><summary>How do we measure success</summary><p>Calls, direction requests, and form fills. Rankings are a leading indicator, conversions are the goal.</p></details>
