        <p>
          We’re the small, hungry Apple Valley team that shows up on time, answers fast, and builds clean.
          We speak human and Google at the same time. We skip buzzwords and focus on the moves that matter:
          pages that load quick, words that are easy to read, and buttons that are obvious to tap.
          Our clients are local owners—restaurants, home services, clinics, shops—people with real work to do
          and no patience for fluff. We get it. You want more calls, more bookings, and fewer headaches.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our “secret” is no secret: clarity beats noise. We learn your offer, write it in plain English,
          design it so it’s impossible to miss, and connect the dots so search engines understand exactly what you do and where you do it.
          When your site is simple, fast, and clear, customers stop bouncing and start calling.
        </p>
        <p>
          We’re not a one-stop shop; we’re a non-stop, all-you-can-eat buffet of useful digital work—without the bloat.
          Need a landing page by Friday? On it. Need your Google Business Profile cleaned up? Done.
          Need content people actually read? We’ll write it and measure it. We chase outcomes, not busywork.

  <section class="section" id="voice">
    <div class="container">
      <div class="surface-min" data-reveal>
        <h2>The digital rodeo (and why it works)</h2>
        <p>
          Imagine the internet as a big, loud county fair. There’s a booth for everything, and a line for nothing—because
          nobody knows where to go. Now imagine your booth: lights on, sign clear, samples ready, staff smiling, and a big
          “Talk to us” button you can’t miss. That’s what we build. Your website becomes the stall people actually walk up to.
        </p>
        <p>
          We mix ninja-quiet precision with wizard-level polish. Ninja: the invisible moves—clean HTML, tight meta, crawlable
          links, sane file sizes, schema that tells search engines the story. Wizard: the visible magic—friendly headings,
          tidy sections, subtle motion that guides the eye, and images that don’t drag the site down.
        </p>
        <p>
          The result is not a “fancy” site. It’s a useful site. Every section has a job. Every sentence has a point.
          Every button has a clear verb. If a part doesn’t help someone understand, decide, or act, we cut it. That’s how
          you get pages that look good, read fast, and earn their keep.

      <h2 data-reveal>How we work (simple and accountable)</h2>
      <div class="surface-min" data-reveal>
        <h3>Phase 1 — Plan (Days 0–14)</h3>
        <p>
          We start with a short call and a quick audit. We look at your Google Business Profile, your current pages,
          your reviews, and your competitors. We list the quick wins and the bigger plays. We set a clear goal:
          calls, bookings, form submits—whatever matters most. Then we draft a simple site map and outline the words we’ll write.
        </p>
        <h3>Phase 2 — Build (Days 15–45)</h3>
        <p>
          We build responsive templates and write the copy. We place your offers high, tuck the details into expandable FAQs,
          and wire your forms so every lead reaches you. We add the local context Apple Valley searches for and connect it
          to nearby areas like Eagan, Burnsville, and Rosemount. We trim scripts, compress images, and ship pages you can edit.
        </p>
        <h3>Phase 3 — Launch & Improve (Days 46–90)</h3>
        <p>
          We run through performance, accessibility, and SEO checks. We add basic events in GA4 and set UTM rules so future
          campaigns are trackable. Then we watch real users. We tweak headlines, move buttons, adjust sections, and keep what works.
          You’ll see the changes and the numbers, not guesswork.

          No wild charts, no mystery dashboards. We show our work: the pages we build, the copy we write, the improvements
          we make. We’d rather hand you a simple checklist than a 40-slide deck. The plan is practical, the deliverables are clear,
          and the changes show up on your phone in the form of calls and messages.

      <div class="card surface-min" data-reveal>
        <details>
          <summary>Do you work with brand-new businesses?</summary>
          <p>Yes. We’ll start with a simple site and a clear Google Business Profile. You’ll get a plan you can grow into, not a bill you regret.</p>
        </details>
        <details>
          <summary>How fast can we see results?</summary>
          <p>Often within 2–4 weeks after core fixes (profile, content, listings). Tougher keywords and larger markets take longer. We focus on steady wins you can measure.</p>
        </details>
        <details>
          <summary>Do we need a page for every city?</summary>
          <p>Usually no. A strong Locations hub plus service pages is enough. We add city pages only when competition calls for it—written for people, not stuffed for bots.</p>
        </details>
        <details>
          <summary>Will the site be fast?</summary>
          <p>Yes. We compress images, trim scripts, and use layouts that keep Core Web Vitals in the green on real phones, not just lab tests.</p>
        </details>
        <details>
          <summary>Can we edit the site ourselves?</summary>
          <p>Absolutely. We avoid fragile builder stacks and give you a short editing guide. If you’d rather not touch it, we’ll handle updates for you.</p>

        <details>
          <summary>What do you track as success?</summary>
          <p>Calls, direction requests, forms, and bookings—recorded with GA4 events and UTM standards. Rankings are helpful, but conversions pay the bills.</p>
        </details>
        <details>
          <summary>What if we already have a site?</summary>
          <p>We’ll audit it. If it’s solid, we’ll improve it. If it’s holding you back, we’ll rebuild what matters and keep what’s working.</p>
